# **Lab Report 2 - Server and Bugs (Week 3)**

**Part 1:** String Server
This part of the lab report required me to create a new server called StringServer. When the path of the URL is changed, a string is displayed on the web page. If we further change the path of the URL, a new string is displayed in the next line along with the previous string. The image attached below shows my code for the ```StringServer``` class. These classes are similar to the files that we worked with in Lab while creating ```NumberServer```.
